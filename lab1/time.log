I did not discuss my solutions with anyone. I used ChatGPT to help me understand concepts in Go, and debugging, but not to write anything from scratch.

This pset was a bit tedious. I learned a lot about gRPC and how to use it in Go. The hardest part was figuring out the structure of the code and planning out the implementation; once that was complete, the assignment could be broken down easily. I also looked a bit ahead and noticed that we could keep one single connection before we got to Part B. The logic about GetStats was completed using just atomic integers, and I used RWMutex for keeping track of the data.

The most tedious part was the unit testing, and coming up with relevant edge cases.
