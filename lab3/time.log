I did not discuss my solutions with anyone. I used ChatGPT to help me understand concepts in Go and Raft, and debugging, but not to write anything from scratch.

For this part, I first started fixing my 3B implementation because it was passing more than just BasicAgree3B from before. I looked through my code and wrote a  very useful debugLog statement with visual cues and some tooling to significantly ease my debugging.

After fixing this, the persistence was pretty simple, the sample code did most of the work and all I needed to do is save things related to the state - votedFor, the log, and the currentTerm. Then, I needed to put it anytime one of those three variables changed.

The harder part was introducing fast log backtracking. For this, I planned out my implementation and defined an interface in AppendEntries (and leaderAppendEntries). After planning this out (the follower would send back the correct term and index so that the server could snap to it, when available), and some debugging later, I completed the implementation.
