For this lab the most confusing thing was figuring out how Rosetta worked in a Linux VM (it didn't). I had to re-set up my Docker environment on macOS which took a while. The kubernetes and docker deployments were otherwise relatively painless after figuring out how to build cross-platform images correctly. Refactoring my code to support connection pools was interesting, mostly because I had already completed the connection reuse step from lab 1 and my code required minimal changes. The last part (C3) I could only notice something when I re-ran the load request many times, because the effects of going from 4 to 8 simultaneous connections on an 2-replica system was not too noticable otherwise.
